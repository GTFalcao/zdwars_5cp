# Revision [current]:

** Gameplay changes **

* Fixed a bug that made Doom keep all summoners when respawning

* Major powerup changes:
	- Powerups will now despawn if they are not picked up after a while. This time defaults to half the respawn time and can be adjusted via CVars;
	- If a powerup despawns instead of being picked up, a new one will spawn in half the usual respawn time;
	- Powerups now spawn in more obvious places, near a random control point. The HUD now shows which powerup spawned and which point it is near;
	- Added two new powerups: double mana regeneration and double mana from pickups;
	- Each powerup now has a unique screen color while active. Invulnerability and Guardsphere were adjusted so as not to impair your visibility.

* ZDW5CP9 (Turmoil): fixed floor height in the elevator section
