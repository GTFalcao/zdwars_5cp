# Revision [current]:

* Fixed incorrect announcer lines in asymmetric mode.









# Revision 2020-10-24:

* You can now watch the game on automap! You can see all monsters moving around, etc. with the console command "am_showthingsprites 3".

** Gameplay changes **

* Fixed a bug that made Doom keep all summoners when respawning

* Major powerup changes:
	- Powerups will now despawn if they are not picked up after a while. This time defaults to half the respawn time and can be adjusted via CVars;
	- If a powerup despawns instead of being picked up, a new one will spawn in half the usual respawn time;
	- Powerups now spawn in more obvious places, near a random control point. The HUD now shows which powerup spawned and which point it is near;
	- Added two new powerups: double mana regeneration and double mana pickups;
	- Each powerup now has a unique screen color while active. Invulnerability and Guardsphere were adjusted so as not to impair your visibility.
